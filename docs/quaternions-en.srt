1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,340
what you were looking at right now is

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,500
something called quaternion

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,210
multiplication or rather you're looking

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,130
at a certain representation of a

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,780
specific motion happening on a

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,580
four-dimensional sphere being

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,200
represented in our three-dimensional

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,020
space one which he'll understand by the

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,680
end of this video

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,010
quarter neons are an absolutely

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,600
fascinating and often underappreciated

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,140
number system from math just as complex

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,970
numbers are a two-dimensional extension

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,920
of the real numbers quaternions

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,750
are a four dimensional extension of

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,090
complex numbers but they're not just

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,100
playful mathematical shenanigans they

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,110
have a surprisingly pragmatic utility

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,790
for describing rotation in three

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,440
dimensions and even for quantum

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,110
mechanics the story of their discovery

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,570
is also quite famous in math the Irish

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,920
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,140
spent much of his life seeking a three

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,210
dimensional number system analogous to

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,699
the complex numbers and as the story

27
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,320
goes his son would ask him every morning

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,879
whether or not he had figured out how to

29
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,739
divide triples and he would always say

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:02,760
no not yet

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,299
but on October 16th 1843 while crossing

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,640
the Broome bridge in Dublin he realized

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
what they supposed flash of insight that

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,180
what he needed was not to add a single

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,460
dimension to the complex numbers but to

36
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,340
add two more imaginary dimensions three

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,229
imaginary dimensions describing space

38
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,970
and the real numbers sitting

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,710
perpendicular to that in some kind of

40
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,020
fourth dimension he carved the crucial

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,310
equation describing these three

42
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,470
imaginary units into the bridge which

43
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,150
today bears a plaque in his honor

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,820
showing that equation now you have to

45
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,189
understand our modern notion of vectors

46
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,570
with their dot product and the cross

47
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,549
product and things like that didn't

48
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,799
really exist in Hamilton's time at least

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,290
not in a standardized form so after his

50
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,450
discovery he pushed hard for Quattro

51
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,850
neons to be the primary language with

52
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,200
which we teach students to describe

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
three-dimensional space even forming an

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,220
official quaternion society to

55
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,350
proselytize his discovery now

56
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,329
unfortunately this was balanced with

57
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,890
mathematicians on the other side of the

58
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,630
fence who believed that the confusing

59
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,880
notion of quaternion multiplication was

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,649
not necessary for describing three

61
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,659
dimensions resulting in some truly

62
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,310
hilarious old-timey trash-talk

63
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,250
legitimately calling them evil

64
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,230
it's even believed that the Mad Hatter

65
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,000
scene from Alice in Wonderland whose

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,380
author you may know was an Oxford

67
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,780
mathematician was written in reference

68
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,030
to quaternions that the chaotic table

69
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,530
placement changes were mocking their

70
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,600
multiplication and that certain quotes

71
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,310
were referencing their non commutative

72
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,490
nature fast forward about a century and

73
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,350
the computing industry gave quaternions

74
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,330
a resurgence among programmers who work

75
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,310
with graphics and robotics and anything

76
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,410
involving orientation in 3d space and

77
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,810
this is because they give an elegant way

78
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,660
to describe and compute 3d rotations

79
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,940
which is computationally more efficient

80
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,800
than other methods and which also avoids

81
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,690
a lot of the numerical errors that arise

82
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,970
in these other methods the 20th century

83
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,800
also brought quaternion some more love

84
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,239
from a completely different direction

85
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,820
quantum mechanics you see the special

86
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,800
actions the quaternions described in

87
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,660
four dimensions are actually quite

88
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,130
relevant to the way the two-state

89
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,140
systems like spin of an electron or the

90
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,180
polarization of a photon are described

91
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,090
mathematically what I'll show you here

92
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,489
is a way to visualize quaternions in

93
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,860
their full four-dimensional glory it

94
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,510
would surprise me if this approach was

95
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,430
fully original but I can say that it's

96
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,019
certainly not the standard way to teach

97
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:18,799
pattern eons

98
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,019
and that the specific four-dimensional

99
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,610
right-hand-rule image that I'd like to

100
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,500
build up to is something that I haven't

101
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,480
really seen elsewhere building up an

102
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,100
understanding for this visual will take

103
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,110
us meaningful time but once you have it

104
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,030
there is a very natural and satisfying

105
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,650
intuition for how to think about

106
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,080
quaternion multiplication it won't be

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,850
until the next video that I show you how

108
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,320
exactly quarter neons describe

109
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,480
orientation in three dimensions which is

110
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,980
for some people the whole reason we care

111
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,140
about it but once we're able to go at it

112
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,489
armed with the image of what they're

113
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,829
doing to a 4d hyper sphere there's a

114
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,630
pleasing understanding to be had for the

115
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,910
otherwise opaque formulas characterizing

116
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,959
this relationship

117
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,000
the structure here will be to start by

118
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,069
imagining teaching complex numbers to

119
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,719
someone who only understands one

120
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,239
dimension then describing 3d rotations

121
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,859
to someone who only understands two

122
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,409
dimensions and ultimately to represent

123
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,120
what quaternions are doing up in four

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,159
dimensions within the constraints of our

125
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,819
3d space

126
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,209
our first character is Linus the line

127
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,699
Lander whose mind can only grasp the one

128
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,500
dimensional geometry of lines in the

129
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,840
algebra of real numbers we're gonna try

130
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,880
to describe complex members to Linus and

131
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,260
it's really important for you to

132
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,060
empathize with him as much as you can

133
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,830
during this because in a few minutes

134
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,139
you're gonna be in his shoes on the one

135
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,940
hand you could define complex numbers

136
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,550
purely algebraically you say each one is

137
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,530
expressed as some real number plus some

138
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,110
other real number times I where pi is a

139
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,270
newly invented constant whose defining

140
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,950
property is that I times I equals

141
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,380
negative one then you say to Linus to

142
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,360
multiply two complex numbers you just

143
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,340
use the distributive property what many

144
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,120
people learn in school is foil

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,110
and you apply this rule that I times I

146
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,880
equals negative one to simplify things

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,130
down further and that's fine that

148
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,900
totally works in the standard textbook

149
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,550
way to introduce Quattro neons is

150
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,560
analogous to this showing the algebraic

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,540
rules and calling it done but I think

152
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,250
something is missing if we don't at

153
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,199
least try to show Linus the geometry of

154
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,820
complex numbers then what complex

155
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,770
multiplication looks like since the

156
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,330
problems in math and physics we're

157
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,220
complex numbers are shockingly useful

158
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,440
often leverage this spatial intuition

159
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,960
you and I who understand two dimensions

160
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,910
might think of it like this when you

161
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,130
multiply two complex numbers Z times W

162
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,979
you can think of Z as a sort of function

163
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,530
acting on W rotating and stretching it

164
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,919
in some way I like to think of this by

165
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,660
broadening the view and asking what does

166
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,910
he do to the entire plane and you can

167
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,470
think of that bird's-eye view action by

168
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,479
imagining using one hand to fix the

169
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
number 0 in place and using another hand

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,760
to drag the point at 1 up to Z since

171
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,100
anything times 0 is 0 and anything times

172
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,220
1 is itself and in two dimensions there

173
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
is one and only one stretching rotating

174
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,510
action on the plane that'll do this this

175
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,010
is also how I'll have you thinking about

176
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,320
quaternion multiplication later on where

177
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,030
the number on the Left acts as a kind of

178
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,740
function to the one on the right and

179
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,690
we'll understand this function by seeing

180
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,729
how it acts by transforming space

181
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,729
although instead of rotating 2d space it

182
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,950
does a sort of double rotation in 4d

183
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,220
space

184
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,540
by the way if you want to review

185
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,250
thinking about complex numbers as a kind

186
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,080
of action a good warm-up for this video

187
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
might be the one I did on e to the PI I

188
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,800
explained with introductory goop theory

189
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,290
now line is the line Lander is pretty

190
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,940
comfortable with the idea of stretching

191
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,410
that's what multiplication by real

192
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,540
numbers looks like maybe it's a little

193
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,980
weird for him to think about stretching

194
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,750
in multiple dimensions but it's not

195
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,000
fundamentally different the difficult

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,590
thing to communicate to Linus is

197
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,980
rotation specifically focus on the unit

198
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,690
circle of the complex plane all the

199
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,330
numbers a distance one from zero since

200
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,710
multiplication by these numbers

201
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,440
corresponds to pure rotation how would

202
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,390
you explain to Linus the look and the

203
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,860
feel of multiplying by these numbers at

204
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,140
first that might seem impossible I mean

205
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,970
rotation is just such an intrinsically

206
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,000
two-dimensional idea but on the other

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,460
hand rotation involves only one degree

208
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,950
of freedom a single number the angle

209
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,250
specifies a given rotation uniquely so

210
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,350
in principle it should be possible to

211
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,810
associate the set of all rotations to

212
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,700
the one dimensional continuum that is

213
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,370
Linus's world and there are many ways

214
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,990
you could do this but the one I'm going

215
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,040
to show you is what's called a

216
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,590
stereographic projection it's a special

217
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,690
way to map a circle onto a line or a

218
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,330
sphere into a plane or even a 4d hyper

219
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,740
sphere into 3d space

220
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,540
for every point on the unit circle draw

221
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,700
a line from negative 1 through that

222
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,890
point and wherever it intersects the

223
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,600
vertical line through the circle Center

224
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,580
that's where the point of the circle

225
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,010
gets projected

226
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,620
so for example the point of one gets

227
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,180
projected into the center of the line

228
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,180
the point I actually stays fixed in

229
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,610
place as does negative I

230
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,580
all of the points on that 90-degree arc

231
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,490
between one and I will get projected

232
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,409
somewhere in the interval between where

233
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,150
one landed and where I landed

234
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,639
as you continue farther around the

235
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,949
circle on the arc between I and negative

236
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,379
one the projected points end up farther

237
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,469
and farther away at an increasing rate

238
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,490
similarly if you come around the other

239
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,799
way towards negative one the projected

240
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,570
points end up farther and farther on the

241
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,390
other end of the line this line of

242
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,860
projected points is what we show to

243
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,649
Linus labeling a few key points like 1

244
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,220
and I and negative 1 all for reference

245
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,019
technically the point at negative 1 has

246
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,970
no projection under this map since the

247
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,410
tangent line to the circle at that point

248
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,079
never crosses the vertical line but what

249
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,029
we say is that negative 1 ends up at the

250
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:57,579
point at infinity this is a special

251
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,110
point you imagine adding to the line

252
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,000
where you would approach it if you walk

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,860
infinitely far along the line in either

254
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,560
direction now it's important to remember

255
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,870
and to remind Linus that what he's

256
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,850
seeing is only the complex numbers that

257
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,950
are a distance 1 from the origin the

258
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,610
unit circle

259
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,850
Linus doesn't see most numbers like 0 or

260
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,940
1 plus I or negative 2 minus I but

261
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,740
that's okay because right now we just

262
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,140
want to describe complex numbers Z we're

263
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,180
multiplying by Z has the effect of a

264
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,490
pure rotation so he only needs to

265
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,269
understand the unit circle

266
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,709
for example when we take the number I

267
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,290
and multiply it by any other complex

268
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,959
number W the effect is to rotate by 90

269
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,690
degrees counterclockwise and when we

270
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,279
apply this action to the circle being

271
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,380
projected down to the line for Linus

272
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,230
what does he see well it's a bit of a

273
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,690
strange morphing action on the line one

274
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,130
which I want you to become familiar with

275
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,470
for something we'll see you later on

276
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,970
it's easiest to understand by following

277
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,300
a few key reference points I times 1 is

278
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,670
I so that means the number 1 should move

279
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,490
up to I I times I is negative 1 so the

280
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,130
point at I slides off to infinity

281
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,420
I times negative 1 is equal to negative

282
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,940
I so that point at infinity kind of

283
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,800
comes back around from the bottom to the

284
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,470
position one unit below the center and I

285
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,560
times negative I is 1 so that point at

286
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,589
negative I slides up to 1 even though

287
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,420
this is kind of a weird motion it lets

288
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,069
us communicate some important ideas to

289
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,610
Linus

290
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,399
for example multiplying by I 4 times

291
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,139
which corresponds to rotating by 90

292
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,360
degrees four times in a row gets us back

293
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,699
to where we started I to the fourth

294
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,370
equals one here to get more of a feel

295
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,110
for things let me just show the circle

296
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,880
rotated at various different angles on

297
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,649
both the left and the right half of the

298
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,959
screen here and putting a hand on the

299
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,240
point that started at the number one to

300
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,490
help us and to help Linus keep track of

301
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,360
the overall motion

302
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,880
[Music]

303
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,140
next let's introduce Felix the

304
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,970
flatlander who only understands

305
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,220
two-dimensional geometry imagine trying

306
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,650
to explain rotations of a sphere to

307
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,360
Felix in the spirit of transitioning

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
from complex numbers to quaternions

309
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,050
let's extend the complex numbers with

310
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,030
its horizontal axis of real numbers and

311
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,890
its vertical axis of imaginary numbers

312
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,560
with a third axis defined by some newly

313
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,230
invented constant J sitting one unit

314
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,180
away from zero perpendicular to the

315
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,670
complex plane instead of having this new

316
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,500
axis in the z direction like you might

317
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,630
expect for a better analogy with how

318
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,730
well visualize quaternions we'll want to

319
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,040
orient things so that the I and the J

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,790
axes sit in the X and the y directions

321
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,530
with the real number line aligned along

322
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,520
the z direction so every point in 3d

323
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,830
space is described as some real number

324
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,920
plus some real number times I plus some

325
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,560
real number times J as it happens it's

326
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,270
not possible to define a notion of

327
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,310
multiplication for a 3d number system

328
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,140
like this that would satisfy the usual

329
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,700
algebraic properties that make

330
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,170
multiplication a useful construct

331
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,540
perhaps all outline why this is the case

332
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,700
in a follow-on video but staying focused

333
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,080
on our current goal think about

334
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,540
describing 3d rotations in this

335
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,400
coordinate system to Felix the

336
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,010
flatlander the unit sphere consists of

337
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,600
all those numbers which are a distance

338
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,420
one from zero at the origin meaning the

339
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,950
sum of the squares of their coordinates

340
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,940
is one we can't show all of 3d space to

341
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,670
Felix but what we can do is project this

342
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,800
2d surface to him and give him a feel

343
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,570
for what reorientation of the sphere

344
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,540
looked like under that projection

345
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,310
analogous to what we did before

346
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,480
stereographic projection will associate

347
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,520
almost every point on the unit sphere

348
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,010
with a unique point on the horizontal

349
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,610
plane defined by the I in the J axes for

350
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,530
each point on the sphere draw a line

351
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,200
from negative 1 at the South Pole

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,060
through that point and see where it

353
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,930
intersects the plane

354
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,320
so the point one at the North Pole ends

355
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
up at the center of the plane all of the

356
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,130
points of the Northern Hemisphere get

357
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,350
mapped somewhere inside the unit circle

358
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,440
of the IJ plane and that unit circle

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,660
which passes through IJ negative I and

360
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,060
negative J actually stays fixed in place

361
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,190
and that's an important point to make

362
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,380
note of even though most points and

363
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,970
lines and patches that Felix the

364
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,740
flatlander sees are going to be Warped

365
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,230
projections of the real sphere this unit

366
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,209
circle is the one thing that he has

367
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,250
which is an honest part of our unit

368
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,680
sphere unaltered by projection all of

369
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,640
the points in the southern hemisphere

370
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,040
get projected outside that unit circle

371
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,529
each getting farther and farther away as

372
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,270
you approach negative one at the South

373
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,000
Pole and again negative one has no

374
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,070
projection under this mapping but what

375
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,080
we say is that it ends up at some point

376
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
at infinity that point at infinity is

377
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,220
something such that no matter which

378
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,110
direction you walk on the plane as you

379
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,970
go infinitely far out you'll be

380
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,070
approaching that point it's analogous to

381
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,870
how if you walk any direction away from

382
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,760
the North Pole you're approaching the

383
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,020
South Pole now let me just pull up a

384
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,700
view of what Felix sees in two

385
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,400
dimensions as I rotate the sphere in

386
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,890
various ways the lines of latitude and

387
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,020
longitude drawn on that sphere get

388
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,089
projected into various circles and lines

389
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,490
in Felix's space and the way I've done

390
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,900
things up here the checkerboard pattern

391
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,370
on the surface of the sphere is

392
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,740
accurately reflected in the projected

393
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,600
view that you see with Felix and the

394
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,940
pink dot represents where the point that

395
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,610
started at the North Pole ends up after

396
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,970
the rotation and that yellow circle

397
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,890
represents where the Equator ended up

398
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,620
after the projection the more you put

399
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,209
yourself in Felix's shoes right now

400
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,980
the easier quarter neons will be in a

401
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,110
moment and as with Linus it helps to

402
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,029
focus on a few key reference objects

403
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,350
rather than trying to see the whole

404
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,079
sphere this circle passing through one

405
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,540
eye negative 1 and negative eye gets

406
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,390
mapped onto a line which Felix sees as

407
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,060
the horizontal axis it's important to

408
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,680
remind Felix that what he sees is not

409
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,670
the same thing as the IX

410
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,350
remember we're only projecting the

411
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,910
numbers that have a distance 1 from the

412
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,640
origin so most points on the actual I

413
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,300
axis like 0 & 2 I and 3i etcetera are

414
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,830
completely invisible to Felix

415
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,690
similarly the circle that passes through

416
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,360
1j negative 1 and negative J gets

417
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,980
projected onto what he sees as a

418
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,130
vertical line and in general any line

419
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,860
that Felix sees comes from some circle

420
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,390
on the sphere that passes through

421
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,390
negative 1 in some sense a line is just

422
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,190
a circle that passes through the point

423
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,450
at infinity now think about what Felix

424
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,570
sees as we rotate the sphere a 90 degree

425
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,360
rotation about the J axis brings one to

426
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,089
I I to negative 1 negative 1 to negative

427
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,930
I and negative I to 1 so what Felix the

428
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,660
flatlander sees is an extension of the

429
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,339
rotation that line is the line lander

430
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,040
was seeing notice also that this action

431
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,860
rotates the I J unit circle to the

432
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,470
position where the 1 J unit circle used

433
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,110
to be so what Felix sees is his yellow

434
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,510
unit circle getting transformed into a

435
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,910
vertical line while that red vertical

436
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,950
line gets transformed into the unit

437
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,680
circle of course from our perspective we

438
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,720
know this is all just rigid motion no

439
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,310
actual stretching or more thing is

440
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,140
taking place all of that is just an

441
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,890
artifact of the projection similarly a

442
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,440
rotation about the I axis involves

443
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,740
moving 1 2 j j 2 negative 1 negative 1

444
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,589
to negative J and negative J 2 1 this

445
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,770
rotation turns the I J unit circle into

446
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,649
the 1i unit circle which to Felix looks

447
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,660
like the unit circle getting transformed

448
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,750
into a horizontal line

449
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:11,290
a rotation about the real axis is

450
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,880
actually quite easy for Felix to

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,709
understand since the whole projection

452
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,540
simply gets rotated about the origin

453
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,280
where the only point staying fixed in

454
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,829
place are one at the origin and negative

455
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:29,950
one off at infinity in the same way that

456
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,780
the complex numbers included the real

457
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,370
numbers with a single extra

458
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,260
quote-unquote imaginary dimension

459
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,020
represented by the unit I and that the

460
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,120
not actually a number system thing we

461
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,740
had in three dimensions included a

462
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,380
second imaginary direction J the

463
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,270
quaternions include the real numbers

464
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,460
together with three separate imaginary

465
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,160
dimensions represented by the unit's I J

466
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,560
and K each of these three imaginary

467
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,900
dimensions is perpendicular to the real

468
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,580
number line and they're all

469
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,900
perpendicular to each other somehow so

470
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,850
in the same way that complex numbers are

471
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,950
represented as a pair of real numbers

472
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,270
each quaternion

473
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,190
can be written using four real numbers

474
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,200
and it lives in four-dimensional space

475
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,420
you often think of this as being broken

476
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,000
up into a real or scalar part and then a

477
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
3d imaginary part and Hamilton used a

478
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,830
special word for quaternions that had no

479
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,680
real part and just ijk components a word

480
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,630
which was previously somewhat foreign in

481
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,900
the lingo of math and physics vector on

482
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,820
the one hand you could just define

483
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,920
quaternion multiplication by giving the

484
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,080
rules for how I J and K multiplied

485
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,150
together and saying that everything must

486
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,460
distribute nicely this is analogous to

487
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,410
defining complex multiplication by

488
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,510
saying that I times I is negative 1 and

489
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,130
then distributing and simplifying

490
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,350
products and indeed this is how you

491
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,700
would tell a computer to perform

492
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,920
quaternion multiplication and the

493
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,990
relative compactness of this operation

494
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,090
compared to say matrix multiplication is

495
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,190
what's made quaternion so useful for

496
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,720
graphics programming and many other

497
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,030
things there's also a rather elegant

498
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,740
form of this multiplication rule written

499
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,210
in terms of the dot product and the

500
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,830
cross product and in some sense

501
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,380
quaternion multiplication subsumes both

502
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,540
of these notions at least as they appear

503
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,020
in three dimensions

504
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,060
but just as a deeper understanding for

505
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,890
complex multiplication comes from

506
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,630
understanding its geometry that

507
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,580
multiplying by a complex number involves

508
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,260
a combination of scaling and rotating

509
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,940
you and I are here for the four

510
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,440
dimensional geometry of quaternion

511
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,200
multiplication and just as the magnitude

512
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,000
of a complex number its distance from

513
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,040
zero is the square root of the sum of

514
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,110
the squares of its component that same

515
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,120
operation gives you the magnitude of a

516
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,580
quaternion and multiplying 1/4 nyan q1

517
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,150
by another q2 has the effect of scaling

518
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,300
q2 by the magnitude of q1 followed by a

519
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,610
very special type of rotation in four

520
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,310
dimensions and those special 4d

521
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,050
rotations the heart of what we need to

522
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,180
understand correspond to the hyper

523
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,490
sphere of quaternions a distance 1 from

524
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,740
the origin both in the sense that the

525
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,080
quaternions whose multiplying action is

526
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,420
a pure rotation live on that hyper

527
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,460
sphere and in the sense that we can

528
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,740
understand this weird 4d action just by

529
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,000
following points on the hyper sphere

530
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,280
rather than trying to look at all of the

531
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,140
points in the inconceivable stretch as a

532
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,990
four dimensional space analogous to what

533
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,700
we did for Linus and Felix we

534
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,590
stereographically project this hyper

535
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,430
sphere into 3d space

536
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,980
[Music]

537
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,500
this label in the upper right is going

538
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,049
to show a given unit quaternion and this

539
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,299
little pink dot will show where that

540
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,640
particular quaternion gets projected in

541
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,669
our 3d space just as before we're

542
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,320
projecting from the number negative one

543
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,390
which sits on the real number line that

544
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,549
is somehow perpendicular to all of our

545
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,549
3d space and beyond our perception just

546
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,590
as before the number one ends up

547
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,330
projected straight into the center of

548
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,299
our space and in the same way that I and

549
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,400
negative I were fixed in place for Linus

550
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,520
and that the IJ unit circle was fixed in

551
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,490
place for Felix we get a whole sphere

552
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,309
passing through I J and K on that unit

553
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,559
hyper sphere which stays in place under

554
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,230
the projection so what we see is a unit

555
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,660
sphere in our 3d space represents the

556
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,760
only unaltered part of the hyper sphere

557
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,840
of quaternions

558
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,150
getting projected down on to us it's

559
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,070
something analogous to the equator of a

560
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,230
3d sphere and it represents all of the

561
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,900
unit quaternions whose real part is zero

562
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,940
what Hamilton would have described as

563
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,250
unit vectors the unit quaternions with

564
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
positive real parts between 0 & 1 end up

565
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,530
somewhere inside this unit sphere closer

566
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,049
to the number 1 in our 3d space which

567
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,250
should feel analogous to how the

568
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,320
Northern Hemisphere got mapped inside

569
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,830
the unit circle for Felix on the other

570
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,419
hand all the unit quaternions with

571
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,340
negative real part end up somewhere

572
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,690
outside that unit sphere

573
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,059
the number negative one is sitting off

574
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,890
at the pointed infinity which you can

575
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,070
easily find by walking in any direction

576
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,510
keep in mind even though we see the

577
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,130
projection of some of these Quatro neons

578
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,929
as being closer or farther from the

579
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,419
origin of our 3d space everything you're

580
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,429
looking at represents a unit quaternion

581
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,350
so everything you're looking at really

582
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,809
has the same magnitude the same distance

583
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,000
from the number zero and that number

584
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,220
zero itself is nowhere to be found in

585
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,410
this picture like all other non unit

586
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,040
quaternions it's invisible to us in the

587
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,840
same way that for Felix the circle

588
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,760
passing through one eye negative one and

589
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,919
negative I got projected into a line

590
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,510
through the origin when we see this line

591
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,549
through the origin passing through I and

592
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,590
negative I we should understand that it

593
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,350
really represents a circle likewise upon

594
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,750
the hyper sphere invisible to us there

595
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,110
is a unit sphere passing through one I J

596
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,360
negative one negative I and negative J

597
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,150
and that whole sphere gets projected

598
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,400
into the plane that we see passing

599
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,820
through one i- i j- j and negative one

600
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,740
off at infinity what you and i might

601
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,740
call the XY plane in general any plane

602
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,990
that you see here really represents the

603
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,179
projection of a sphere somewhere up on

604
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,650
the hyper sphere which passes through

605
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,059
the number negative one now the action

606
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,890
of taking a unit quaternion and

607
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,049
multiplying it by any other quaternion

608
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:26,570
from the left can be thought of in terms

609
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,240
of two separate 2d rotations happening

610
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,340
perpendicular to and in sync with each

611
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,350
other in a way that could only ever be

612
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,809
possible in four dimensions as a first

613
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,610
example let's look at multiplication by

614
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,250
I we already know what this does to the

615
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,110
circle that passes through one and I

616
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,100
which we see as a line

617
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,389
one goes to I I goes to negative one off

618
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:52,990
at infinity negative one comes back

619
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,509
around to negative I and negative I goes

620
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,090
to one remember just like what lino saw

621
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,620
all of this is the stereographic

622
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,279
projection of a 90 degree rotation now

623
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,080
look at the circle passing through J and

624
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,600
K which is in a sense perpendicular to

625
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,480
the circle passing through one and I now

626
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,950
it might feel weird to talk about two

627
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,509
circles being perpendicular to each

628
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:15,399
other especially when they have the same

629
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,019
center the same radius and they don't

630
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,149
touch each other at all but nothing

631
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,830
could be more natural in four dimensions

632
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,590
you can think of the action of I on this

633
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,389
perpendicular circle as obeying a

634
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:28,210
certain right hand rule if you'll excuse

635
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,070
the intrusion of my ghostly green screen

636
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,509
hand into our otherwise pristine

637
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:34,149
platonic mathematical stage you let that

638
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,950
thumb of your right hand point from the

639
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,769
number 1 to I and you curl your fingers

640
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,889
the JK circle will rotate in the

641
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:45,220
direction of that curl how much well by

642
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,320
the same amount as the one I circle

643
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,840
rotates which is 90 degrees in this case

644
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,360
this is what I meant by two rotations

645
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,850
perpendicular to and in sync with each

646
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,860
other so J goes to K K goes to negative

647
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,220
J

648
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,530
negative J goes to negative K and

649
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,730
negative K goes to J this gives us a

650
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,740
little table for what the number I does

651
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,960
to the other quaternions but I want this

652
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,220
not to be something that you memorize

653
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,840
but something that you could close your

654
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,870
eyes and you could really see

655
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,890
computationally if you know what a

656
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,890
quaternion does to the numbers 1 IJ and

657
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,559
K you know what it does to any arbitrary

658
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,420
quaternion since multiplication

659
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,850
distributes nicely in the language of

660
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,480
linear algebra 1 I J and K form a basis

661
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,030
of our four dimensional space so knowing

662
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,590
what our transformation does to them

663
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,020
gives us the full information about what

664
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,900
it does to all of space geometrically a

665
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,760
four dimensional creature would be able

666
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,500
to look at those two perpendicular

667
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,059
rotations that I just described and

668
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,580
understand that they lock you into one

669
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,710
and only one rigid motion for the hyper

670
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,230
sphere we might lack the intuitions of

671
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,210
such a hypothetical creature but we can

672
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,400
maybe try to get close here's what the

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,260
action of repeatedly multiplying by I

674
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,240
looks like on our stereographic

675
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,080
projection of the ijk sphere it gets

676
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
rotated into what we see as a plane then

677
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,100
gets rotated further back to where it

678
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,750
used to be though the orientation is all

679
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,990
reversed now then it gets rotated again

680
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,270
into what we see as a plane and after

681
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,920
the fourth iteration it ends up right

682
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,650
back where it started as another example

683
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,290
think of a quaternion like q equals

684
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,630
negative square root of 2 over 2 plus

685
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,480
square root of 2 over 2 times i which if

686
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,010
we pull up a picture of a complex plane

687
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,210
is a 135 degree rotation away from 1 in

688
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,150
the direction of i under our projection

689
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,370
we see this along the line from 1 to i

690
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,830
somewhere outside the unit sphere if

691
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,960
that sounds weird just remember how

692
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
linus would have seen the same number

693
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,940
the action of multiplying this Q by all

694
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,050
other quarter neons

695
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,210
will look to us like dragging the point

696
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,429
at 1 all the way to this projected

697
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,250
version of Q while the JK circle gets

698
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,070
rotated 135 degrees according to our

699
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,760
right-hand rule

700
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:11,729
multiplication by any other quaternion

701
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:14,339
is completely similar for example let's

702
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,139
see what it looks like for Jay to act on

703
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:18,089
other quaternions by multiplication from

704
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,479
the left the circle through 1 + J which

705
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,489
we see projected as a line through the

706
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:26,129
origin gets rotated 90 degrees

707
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,329
dragging 1 up to J so J times 1 is 1 + J

708
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:39,029
times J is negative 1 the circle

709
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,249
perpendicular to that 1 passing through

710
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,759
I and K gets rotated 90 degrees

711
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,229
according to this right-hand rule where

712
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,749
you point your thumb from 1 to J so J

713
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:56,809
times I is negative K and J times K is I

714
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:03,959
in general for any other unit quaternion

715
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,449
you see somewhere in space start by

716
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,249
drawing the unit circle passing through

717
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:11,549
1 Q and negative 1 which we see in our

718
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,399
projection as a line through the origin

719
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,809
then draw the circle perpendicular to

720
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,789
that one on what we see as the unit

721
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:20,609
sphere you rotate the first circle so

722
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,369
that one ends up where Q was and rotate

723
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,259
the perpendicular circle by the same

724
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,999
amount according to the right hand rule

725
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,070
one thing worth noticing here is that

726
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,440
order of multiplication matters it's not

727
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,629
as mathematicians would say commutative

728
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:50,049
for example I times J is K which you

729
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,909
might think of in terms of I acting on

730
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,970
the quaternion J rotating it up to K but

731
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,580
if you think of J is acting on I J times

732
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,860
I it rotates I to negative K in fact

733
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,240
commutativity this ability to swap the

734
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,370
order of multiplication is a way more

735
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,929
special property than a lot of people

736
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,870
realize and most groups of actions on

737
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,210
some space don't have it it's like how

738
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,129
in solving a rubik's cube order matters

739
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:15,809
a lot

740
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,549
or how rotating a cube about the z axis

741
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,100
and then about the x axis gives a

742
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,049
different final state from rotating it

743
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,450
about the x axis then about the z axis

744
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,029
and last as one final but rather

745
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:33,070
important point so far i've shown you

746
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,200
how to think about quaternions as acting

747
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,419
by left multiplication where when you

748
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,549
read an expression like i times j you

749
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,259
think of i as a kind of function

750
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,539
morphing all of space and j is just one

751
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,490
of the points that it's acting on but

752
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,899
you can also think of them as a

753
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:48,909
different sort of action by multiplying

754
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:50,889
from the right where in this expression

755
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,460
j would be acting on i in that case the

756
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,230
rule for multiplication is very similar

757
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,990
it's still the case that one goes to j

758
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,690
and j goes to negative 1 etc but instead

759
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,700
of applying the right-hand rule to the

760
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,799
circle perpendicular to the 1j circle

761
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,350
you would use your left hand so either

762
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,289
way i times j is equal to k but you can

763
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,059
either think about this with your right

764
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,340
hand curling the number j to the number

765
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,789
k as your thumb points from 1 to i or as

766
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:22,299
your left hand curling I to K as it's

767
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,480
thumb points from 1 to J understanding

768
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,250
this left hand rule for multiplication

769
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,559
from the other side will be extremely

770
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,509
useful for understanding how unit

771
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:34,029
quaternions describe rotation in three

772
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:37,330
dimensions and so far it's probably not

773
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,340
clear how exactly quarter neons do

774
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,830
describe 3d rotation I mean if you

775
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,539
consider one of these actions on the

776
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,149
unit sphere passing through I J and K it

777
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,679
doesn't leave that sphere in place it

778
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,809
morphs it out of position so the way

779
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,159
that this works is slightly more

780
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,840
complicated than a single quaternion

781
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,389
product

782
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:55,969
it involves a process called conjugation

783
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,950
and I'll make a full follow-on video all

784
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,570
about it so that we have the time to go

785
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,389
through some examples in the meantime

786
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:04,399
for more information on the story of

787
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,839
quaternions and their relation to

788
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,749
orientation in 3d space quanta a

789
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:10,579
mathematical publication I'm sure a lot

790
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,229
of you are familiar with just put out a

791
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:13,879
post in a kind of loose conjunction with

792
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:17,119
this video link in the description if

793
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,039
you enjoyed this consider sharing it

794
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,659
with some friends and if you felt like

795
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:21,979
the narrative structure here was

796
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,349
actually helpful for understanding maybe

797
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,029
reassure those friends who would be

798
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:27,679
turned off by a large timestamp that

799
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,009
good math is actually worth the time and

800
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:32,539
many thanks to the patrons among you I

801
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,579
actually spent way longer than I care to

802
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,709
admit on this project so your patience

803
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,749
and support is especially appreciated

804
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:41,349
this time around
